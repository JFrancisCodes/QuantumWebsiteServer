<h3>Welcome to this website, designed to help students studying the Mathematical Quantum Theory course at the University of Tübingen gain a conceptual understanding of quantum processes, particularly the evolution of the Free Schrödinger Equation. Have a look at some of the links below</h3>


<h3> 1. <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/qanim/animations">Particle in a Box</a>: Here you can watch some animations 
    of the 'box' distribution evolve under the schrodinger equation. This corresponds to the physical case where a particle is trapped so that it has a unform probablility 
    distribution within some volume, before being released and allowed to evolve under the Free Schrödinger Equation. We also show the case of intial distribution of two 'boxes', 
    it is worth considering what the physical interpertation of this is. 
</h3>

<h3> 2. <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/qanim/single_gaussian">Single Gaussian</a>: Here we look at the evolution of a Gaussian distribution under the 
Free Schrodinger equation. How does the standard deviation and it's initial fourier transform affect the evolution of this distribution? Change the parameters and watch how 
the wavefunction evolves.
</h3>

<h3> 3. <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/qanim/double_gaussian">Double Gaussian</a>: Here we look at the evolution of two Gaussian distributions.
    As the Schrödinger equation is linear, this corresponds to adding the solutions for each gaussian. What should we expect happens here? How will the two
    Gaussians interact, and what will be the long term behaviour.
</h3>

<h3> 4. <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/qanim/heatwavesch">Heat, Wave and Schrödinger Equation Comparison</a>: Here we compare
    the three most important second order differential eqautions in physics. </h3>


<h3> 5. <a class="regular-link" href="https://github.com/ayroy78/Quantum-Animations">GitHub Project</a>: Here is our
GitHub page, it contains all the code used to generate this website, aswell as apps that you can run on your own computer. </h3>


<h3>This website and its inbuilt functionality were developed by Ayush Roy and Joe Francis, under the guidance of Prof. Marius Lemm, Prof. Dr. Stefan Teufel and JProf. Dr. Angela Capel Cuevas</h3>
